3. **Multi-tenancy**: Company-based data isolation
4. **File Upload**: Validated file types and sizes
5. **Email**: Server-side sending via Edge Functions
6. **Audit Trail**: Email logs, interview tracking

## Support & Maintenance

### Key Files to Monitor
- `src/hooks/useRecruitmentData.ts` - Main data hook (large file)
- `src/lib/supabase.ts` - Database client and company ID resolution
- `supabase/functions/send-email/index.ts` - Email sending function

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: Emails not sending
