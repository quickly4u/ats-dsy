## Database Schema Analysis

### Well-Designed Tables
- `companies` - Proper multi-tenancy foundation
- `clients` - Comprehensive client data with JSONB for contract details
- `custom_stages` - Flexible pipeline management
- `applications` - Good application tracking structure
- `candidates` - Proper candidate profile management

### Tables Needing Attention
- `interview_participants` - May have schema issues affecting form submissions
- `spocs` vs `client_spocs` - Potential duplication/confusion
- Missing indexes on frequently queried company_id columns

## Key Technical Strengths

1. **Multi-tenancy:** Excellent company-based data isolation
2. **Real-time Data:** Proper Supabase integration with live updates
3. **Custom Stages:** Advanced pipeline customization capabilities
4. **Type Safety:** Strong TypeScript implementation
5. **Component Architecture:** Well-structured React components with custom hooks

## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. Interview Form Submission (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Problem:** Users report interview data not getting submitted despite form completion
- **Investigation Needed:**
  - Check `createInterview` function in `useRecruitmentData.ts` (lines 923-989)
  - Verify `interview_participants` table schema
  - Add comprehensive error logging
- **Impact:** Prevents interview scheduling workflow

### 2. Error Handling & User Feedback
- **Problem:** Limited error feedback to users when operations fail
- **Solution Needed:** Implement toast notifications or better error displays
- **Impact:** Poor user experience when things go wrong

### 3. Data Validation
- **Problem:** Some forms may lack proper validation before submission
- **Solution Needed:** Add client-side and server-side validation
- **Impact:** Data integrity issues

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (1-2 weeks)
1. **Fix Interview Submission:** Debug and resolve interview form submission issues
2. **Add Error Handling:** Implement proper error notifications throughout the app
3. **Database Optimization:** Add missing indexes for company_id columns
4. **Form Validation:** Strengthen validation across all forms

### Short-term Improvements (1 month)

## Conclusion

The ATS Pro application has a solid foundation with most core functionality working correctly. The multi-tenant architecture is well-implemented, and the custom pipeline management is particularly impressive. The main issue requiring immediate attention is the interview form submission problem, which affects a critical user workflow.

The application demonstrates good engineering practices with proper TypeScript usage, component separation, and database design. With the identified issues resolved, this would be a robust and feature-complete ATS solution.

**Overall Assessment:** 85% functional with 1 critical issue and several enhancement opportunities.
