# User Invitation Fix - Configuration Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **AcceptInvitation Component** ‚úÖ
Updated to properly handle Supabase invitation links:
- Removed requirement for `type=invite` parameter
- Now properly detects and processes Supabase `inviteUserByEmail` links
- Automatically sets session from invitation token
- Better error handling for already-accepted invitations

### 2. **Required Supabase Configuration** üîß

You need to configure the Supabase redirect URL to ensure invitation emails work correctly.

## Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Configure Redirect URLs in Supabase

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: **ATS** (Project ID: `jivccjpzcecljzuzxxhx`)
3. Navigate to **Authentication** ‚Üí **URL Configuration**
4. Add the following URLs to **Redirect URLs**:

   **For Local Development:**
   ```
   http://localhost:5173/accept-invitation
   ```

   **For Production:**
   ```
   https://your-production-domain.com/accept-invitation
   ```

5. Set the **Site URL** to your main application URL:
   - Development: `http://localhost:5173`
   - Production: `https://your-production-domain.com`

6. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Customize Email Template (Optional but Recommended)

1. In Supabase Dashboard, go to **Authentication** ‚Üí **Email Templates**
2. Select **Invite User** template
3. Customize the email to match your branding
4. Make sure the confirmation URL button/link is present (it uses `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}`)

**Example Email Template:**
```html
<h2>You've been invited to join {{ .CompanyName }}!</h2>
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>You have been invited to join {{ .CompanyName }} on ATS Pro.</p>
<p>Click the button below to accept the invitation and set up your account:</p>
<p><a href="{{ .ConfirmationURL }}">Accept Invitation</a></p>
<p>If the button doesn't work, copy and paste this link into your browser:</p>
<p>{{ .ConfirmationURL }}</p>
<p>This invitation will expire in 24 hours.</p>
```

## How the Fixed Flow Works

### Before (Broken):
1. ‚ùå User clicks invitation link
2. ‚ùå AcceptInvitation looks for `type=invite` parameter (doesn't exist)
3. ‚ùå Shows "Invalid invitation link" error
4. ‚ùå User never sets password
5. ‚ùå User remains inactive

### After (Fixed):
1. ‚úÖ User clicks invitation link from email
2. ‚úÖ AcceptInvitation detects `access_token` in URL hash
3. ‚úÖ Establishes session with the token
4. ‚úÖ Looks up pending invitation in database
5. ‚úÖ Shows password creation form
6. ‚úÖ User creates password
7. ‚úÖ Updates user status to `active`
8. ‚úÖ Updates invitation status to `accepted`
9. ‚úÖ Redirects to dashboard

## Testing the Fix

### For Existing Pending Invitations:

If you have users who already received invitations but couldn't complete setup:

1. **Resend the invitation**:
   - Go to Team Management
   - Delete the existing inactive user (or mark for resend)
   - Send a new invitation

2. **Or manually activate them**:
   - Have the user reset their password via Supabase Auth
   - Manually set `is_active = true` in the database

### For New Invitations:

1. Go to **Team Management**
2. Click **Invite User**
3. Fill in user details
4. Click **Send Invitation**
5. **Check the invited user's email**
6. Click **Accept Invitation** link in email
7. User should see the password creation form
8. Create password (min 8 chars, uppercase, lowercase, numbers)
9. Click **Complete Setup**
10. User should be redirected to dashboard
11. Status should now show **Active** in Team Management

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: User still sees "Invalid invitation link"

**Solution**: 
- Verify the redirect URL is configured in Supabase
- Check that the invitation link hasn't expired (24 hour default)
- Ensure the user hasn't already accepted the invitation

### Issue: User can't set password

**Solution**:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Supabase session is established
- Ensure the invitation record exists in `team_invitations` table

### Issue: Status still shows "Inactive" after acceptance

**Solution**:
- Check if `is_active` was properly updated in the `users` table
- Verify the invitation status changed from `pending` to `accepted`
- Try refreshing the Team Management page

### Issue: Invitation email not received

**Solution**:
- Check spam/junk folder
- Verify email address is correct
- Check Supabase email logs (Dashboard ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Logs)
- Ensure SMTP is configured (for production)

## Database Queries for Debugging

### Check invitation status:
```sql
SELECT 
  email, 
  status, 
  auth_user_id, 
  created_at 
FROM team_invitations 
WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```

### Check user activation status:
```sql
SELECT 
  id, 
  email, 
  is_active, 
  created_at 
FROM users 
WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```

### Manually activate a user (if needed):
```sql
UPDATE users 
SET is_active = true 
WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```

### Check invitation and user status together:
```sql
SELECT 
  ti.email,
  ti.status as invitation_status,
  u.is_active as user_active,
  ti.created_at as invited_at,
  u.created_at as user_created_at
FROM team_invitations ti
LEFT JOIN users u ON u.id = ti.auth_user_id
WHERE ti.email = 'user@example.com';
```

## Summary of Changes

### Files Modified:
1. `/src/components/auth/AcceptInvitation.tsx`
   - Removed `type=invite` requirement
   - Added automatic session establishment
   - Improved error handling
   - Better invitation status checking

### What Stays the Same:
- Edge Function (`invite-user`) - no changes needed
- Team Management UI - works as before
- Database schema - no changes needed
- Email sending mechanism - same

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Configure Supabase redirect URLs** (see Step 1 above)
2. ‚úÖ **Test with a new invitation**
3. ‚úÖ **Optionally customize email template**
4. ‚úÖ **For existing pending invitations, resend them**

**Note**: The fix is backward compatible. Existing users can still log in normally. Only the invitation acceptance flow was updated.
